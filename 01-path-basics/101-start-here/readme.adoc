这部分根据客户情况进行了大幅修订，目前采用EC2 Amazon-Linux作为实验用登陆环境，下面会引导大家创建EC2的登陆环境.

== 创建EC2登陆环境
=== Amazon Linux

We can create the EC2 development environment via CloudFormation.
This CloudFormation template will spin up the EC2 Instance, as well as configure the environment for the rest of the workshop.



Click on the "Deploy to AWS" button and follow the CloudFormation prompts to begin.

[NOTE]
The CloudFormation template create a new VPC. VPC & EC2 Name all equal to Stack Name you input when create a Cloudformation Stack.
Please Use K8SWorkshop.pem as a Key file to access ec2-user@ for your enviroment.

|Region | Launch template with a new VPC
| *Tokyo* (ap-northeast-1)

|===

To Access EC2 Public IP address, which is dynamic changed, click on the "Outputs" tab in CloudFormation Console and Check the Output.

=== Build Script

这部分特意没有自动化，大家需要手动准备系统环境，通过手动的过程可以了解到有哪些必备因素。
Once your EC2 is ready, download the build script and install in your EC2. This will prepare your Enviroment for running tutorials in this workshop. The build script installs the following:

- jq
- kubectl _(the Kubernetes CLI, which we'll cover in great detail later in the workshop)_
- kops _(Kubernetes Operations, which we'll also cover in detail later)_
- configures the AWS CLI and stores necessary environment variables in bash_profile
- creates an SSH key
- clone the workshop repository into EC2

To install the script, run this command in the "bash" terminal tab of the EC2 IDE:

    aws s3 cp s3://yonyousharing/lab-ide-build.sh . && \
    chmod +x lab-ide-build.sh && \
    . ./lab-ide-build.sh



You are now ready to continue on with the workshop!

:grid: none
:valign: top

== Workshop Cleanup

Once you have finished with the workshop, please don't forget to spin down your cluster or you will incur additional charges.
(We will also remind you at the end!)

==== Delete Kubernetes cluster resources

In your EC2 IDE, check if there are any running kubernetes cluster

   $ kops get cluster

Delete kubernetes cluster

   $ kops delete cluster example.cluster.k8s.local --yes

Wait until all resources are deleted by kops

==== Delete EC2 Envionment

Go to CloudFormation console, right click template with You Stack name like 'k8s-workshop' and select 'Delete Stack'

This should delete all the resources associated with this workshop


== Appendix: Manual Cloud9 Configuration

This appendix provides instructions for those who don't want to use the provided CloudFormation template, or who would like to configure Cloud9 manually.

AWS Cloud9 is only available in 5 regions currently. Please choose the region closest to you geographically.

[cols="1*^"]
|===
|link:https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home/create[*N. Virginia* (us-east-1)]
|link:https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home/create[*Ohio* (us-east-2)]
|link:https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home/create[*Oregon* (us-west-2)]
|link:https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home/create[*Ireland* (eu-west-1)]
|link:https://ap-southeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home/create[*Singapore* (ap-southeast-1)]
|===

Once there, follow these steps:

1. Provide a name for your environment.  Feel free to use something simple, such as `k8s-workshop`.  Then click "Next Step".

2. Change the "Instance Type" to `t2.small (2 GiB RAM + 1 vCPU)`.

3. Expand the "Network settings (advanced)" section and make sure you are using the default VPC.  It will have "(default)" next to the name.  If you do not have a default VPC listed, it is recommended that you create a "Single Public Subnet" VPC by clicking the "Create new VPC" button and following the wizard it presents.

4. If everything is correct, click the "Next Step" button.

5. Review the configuration to ensure everything is correct and then click the "Create environment" button.

This will close the wizard and you will be taken to a screen informing you that your new AWS Cloud9 environment is being created.  Once this is completed, the IDE will open to the following screen:

Your environment is now ready to be setup for working with Kubernetes and the rest of this workshop.

=== Set up Environment

Your AWS Cloud9 environment comes with many useful tools preinstalled, but there are still a few tweaks to these and additional tools you will need to support working with Kubernetes.

=== Configure the AWS CLI

Your AWS Cloud9 environment comes with the AWS CLI preinstalled and configured to automatically use the credentials of the currently logged in user. Make sure you are logged in as a user with link:aws-permissions.adoc[these permissions.]

[NOTE]
*********************
It is not recommended that you change the default AWS CLI config in your AWS Cloud9 environment. Instead, it is recommended that you provide the logged in user's account the permissions needed to make any requests needed by your project.  More information on this can be found by visiting: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/credentials.html[Calling AWS Services from an Environment in AWS Cloud9]
*********************

[NOTE]
All the commands below should be run in the Terminal section of your Cloud9 GUI.

=== Verify Docker Version

Docker is preinstalled.  You can verify the version by running the following:

    $ docker --version
    Docker version 17.06.2-ce, build 3dfb8343b139d6342acfd9975d7f1068b5b1c3d3

You should have a similar or newer version.

=== Install Kubectl CLI

Install the Kubectl CLI:

    $ curl -Lo kubectl https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.9.2/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl && chmod +x kubectl && sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/

Add kubectl autocompletion to your current shell:

    $ source <(kubectl completion bash)

You can verify that kubectl is installed by executing the following command:

    $ kubectl version --client
    Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"9", GitVersion:"v1.9.2", GitCommit:"6e937839ac04a38cac63e6a7a306c5d035fe7b0a", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2017-09-28T22:57:57Z", GoVersion:"go1.8.3", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}

=== Install kops

Install kops using the following:

    $ curl -LO https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/download/$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d '"' -f 4)/kops-linux-amd64
    $ chmod +x kops-linux-amd64
    $ sudo mv kops-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/kops

=== Collect Availability Zones

kops needs to know the availability zones to use when configuring a cluster. We set an environment variable `$AWS_AVAILABILITY_ZONES` based on the region.

    $ export AWS_AVAILABILITY_ZONES="$(aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --query 'AvailabilityZones[].ZoneName' --output text | awk -v OFS="," '$1=$1')"

=== Configure an S3 bucket for kops

kops needs a "`state store`" to store configuration information of the cluster. We will use a s3 bucket with versioning enabled. A state store can work with multiple kops clusters.

[NOTE]
The bucket name must be unique otherwise you will encounter an error on deployment. We will use an example bucket name of `kops-state-store-` and add a randomly generated string to the end.

    $ export S3_BUCKET=kops-state-store-$(cat /dev/urandom | LC_ALL=C tr -dc "[:alpha:]" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | head -c 32)
    $ export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://${S3_BUCKET}
    $ aws s3 mb $KOPS_STATE_STORE
    $ aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket $S3_BUCKET --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled

=== Clone the repository

The workshop repository has configuration files that are used to create Kubernetes resources.  You need to clone the repo to have access to those files:

    $ git clone https://github.com/jief123/aws-workshop-for-kubernetes

At this point, you should have everything you need to complete any of the sections of the this workshop using your Cloud9 Environment.
