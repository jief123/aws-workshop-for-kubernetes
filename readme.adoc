This is a self-paced workshop designed for Development and Operations teams who would like to leverage Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

This workshop provides instructions to create, manage, and scale a Kubernetes cluster on AWS, as well as how to deploy applications, scale them, run stateless and stateful containers, perform service discovery between different microservices, and other similar concepts.

It also shows deep integration with several AWS technologies.

We recommend at least 2 hours to complete the workshop.
